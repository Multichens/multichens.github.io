<h1>I'm The Best</h1>
<p>My name is Vinson Chen. I was born in New York, but grew up in Michigan. After middle school, my family and I moved back to New York. I now attend the University at Buffalo as a computer science major. I usually spend most of my free time on the computer.
I enjoy listening to music, playing videogames, watching YouTube videos, and interacting with my close friends online.</p>
